This is the official code for the paper 'DeepPtych: Subsampled Fourier Ptychography using Deep Generative Priors'. The code has been written in both MATLAB and tensorflow. For the generation of .mat files, we use the official code of the paper 'Toward long-distance subdiffraction imaging using coherent camera arrays'. For the generative models part, the tensorflow code (ipython notebook) has been provided in this repository. We will update the description soon.
